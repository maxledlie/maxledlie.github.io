I'm currently attending [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/): a 12 week self-directed programming retreat.

## Projects

Over ten years of programming I've accumulated many small side projects. I'm now trying to curate these here.

### [Asteroids Clone](/asteroids) (Jan 2022)

To learn the basics of game development with Unity, I created this slightly remixed version of the classic arcade game.

### [Modular Mandalas](https://maxledlie.observablehq.cloud/computologies/modular_mandala) (Dec 2024)

Trying to build intuition for modular arithmetic resulted in some very cool animations.
