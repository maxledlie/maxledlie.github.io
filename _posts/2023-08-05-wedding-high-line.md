We attended W&G's wedding! A lovely day celebrating a beautiful couple, and so much fun that I forgot to take any pictures.

After the wedding we changed our accommodation, moving from Manhattan to an AirBnB in Brooklyn. This was a welcome relief from the noise and crowds in the city centre.
Over the next few days we wandered around Brooklyn and took the ferry into the city to visit the High Line, the Empire State Building and the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.
