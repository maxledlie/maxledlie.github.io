A fun weekend in the Cairngorms with Alistair and Jonny.
We stayed the Friday and Saturday nights at Alistair's family cottage (my fourth time there).
On Saturday we climbed Cairn Gorm ([a repeat after 18 years!](https://corminowyke.blogspot.com/2005/07/cairngorm.html)), Ben MacDui and Derry Cairngorm.
Low clouds made for poor views from the summits. Some ice patches were still hanging on in the corries despite the 25C heat in the valleys below.

The original plan was to climb two further munros on the way home on Sunday, but storms rolled in so we enjoyed a lie-in instead before the drive.
