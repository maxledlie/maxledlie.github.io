A photo dump from the remainder of our New York trip!

Highlights included:

- The Natural History museum was so good we went twice
- The Brooklyn Bridge was worth the sun stroke
- Interesting geometric sculptures by [Gego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gego) at the Guggenheim
- A relaxing day on Rockaway Beach
- Amazing views and insanely strong cocktails at Summit One to say goodbye to the city

P.S. Sorry if photos don't fit on screen, too tired to fix now.
