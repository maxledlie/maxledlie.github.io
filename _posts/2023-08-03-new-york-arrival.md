Retroactively adding some posts as it's been a busy couple of months!

Kasia and I travelled to New York City for a friend's wedding. Touched down around 6pm and had an intense few hours navigating to the hotel equipped with a 15kg suitcase and very little sleep.

The next morning we had the first of many long walks around the city, visiting Central Park and later the west waterfront. We enjoyed the architecture and turtles, but struggled a bit from the heat.
On the 4th, feeling more rested, we put our tourist hats on and visited Bryant Park, Grand Central Station and Times Square.
