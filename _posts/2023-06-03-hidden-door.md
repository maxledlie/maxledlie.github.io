We took a trip to Edinburgh to go to the [Hidden Door](https://hiddendoorarts.org/) festival with Alistair.
This year, the festival was in the [disused Scottish Widow Headquarters](https://c20society.org.uk/buildings-at-risk/scottish-widows-headquarters-edinburgh) building.
I found most of the bands and the "immersive experiences" a little underwhelming, but really liked exploring the building, and the dancier acts at the end of the night.
