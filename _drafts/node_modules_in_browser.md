## A setup for testing a local npm package in the browser

Scenario: You are developing a library that is meant to run in the browser and manipulate DOM elements. Something like a React or jQuery.

```terminal
mkdir local-package-demo
cd local-package-demo

mkdir my-package
mkdir my-app

cd my-app
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```
